# Coding exercise - Zaid Ziad
<ul>
	<li>
		<b>Why Java?</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Java is powerful and fast to create services</li>
			<li>I am fluent in Java so it is easier for me to do it fast</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Thoughts about API</b>
		<ul>
			<li>I assumed that the max stay days should be limited so I set the limit to 60</li>
			<li>Could not find API documentation (i.e. swagger) I tried to find other parameters like lang but I could not :)</li>
			<li>Unknown parameters will not be passed to the API</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>What want to accomplish</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Hotel offers service that validates the request before sending it to the API, so the whole focus was to make sure the validation is correct.<li>
			<li>Controllers are not included in the test, I will try to add their test.</li>
			<li>All exception error message are in format of XXX.XXX.XXX to make localization easier and cleaner, currently the application returns the error as it is.</li>
		<ul>
	</li>
</ul>
